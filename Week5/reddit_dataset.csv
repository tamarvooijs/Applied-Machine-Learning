"I've no experience with slotervaart, but around where I live 'normal' harassment rate is zero and I haven't noticed any change.",2020-04-03 12:43:12
"Maybe you live in a nicer part of town? First time I was being catcalled I was in grade 7, so 11. Zuidoost, great place to grow up but not to be a grown-up.",2020-04-03 08:12:03
"Yes I've had the same experience! When exercising outside it used to be around 50/50, but the last two weeks multiple times in the same runs, without exception. I think it's boredom yes. Someone actually got kind of close but I coughed haha, did the trick.",2020-04-03 08:10:40
"In my experience Dutch dudes don't catcall. Definitely I've noticed more head turning, but I've been turning my head a lot more too. Boredom is a nice way of putting it.",2020-04-03 06:14:15
"Holy shit, that's just terrible. I am a male student here; came here last August and I haven't heard any of my female friends being catcalled while going for a run.",2020-04-02 20:46:55
"I haven’t dealt with that at all whatsoever but I don’t live in that area so can’t speak to that. Could it be the same person again and again(super rare I know)? Try to look out for that.",2020-04-02 19:50:06
"I had one delivered today. I opened the door with the buzzer and he just left the package at the bottom of the stairs. I was supposed to sign for it but I guess they're not doing that given the context.",2020-04-02 16:26:30
"Hm interesting, why do they not just count them in the entrance. Cause sometimes carts block paths even more so that you'd have to go by even closer",2020-04-02 13:37:27
"Hey guys, does anyone have any recent experience with UPS? Other than the delays, have you received your packages as normal? Or were there a lot of missing packages?",2020-04-02 13:32:25
"Not to mention a delinquent. Coughing on people is considered aggravated assault by police during the coronavirus outbreak.",2020-04-02 12:14:25
"I don’t know if this is for every Albert Heijn, but the one in zuidas requires you to take a cart with you so they can control the amount of people in the store, but also put some space between people (not super effective to keep distance but it is for controlling the amount of people in the store).",2020-04-02 11:55:02
"Delays with the hotel here not the bank. Maybe they don’t have any finance or accounting staff able to process/approve/reconcile.",2020-04-02 11:19:25
"I actually tried to book online, my appointment request was rejected. When I called them, nobody answered the phone. When I visit the premise, they put a sign saying that they don’t take regular consultations. I was just confused. Maybe I can call them again. Thanks for the response.",2020-04-02 08:18:42
"Sure, shouldn’t be a problem. Might be best to inform the specialist in advance in case they want to reserve some extra time for the appointment.",2020-04-02 07:52:09
"Amazing that some people are still eager to downvote this advice and repeat the same lies. There's an enormous, longstanding amount of scientific evidence that even basic masks provide significant protection. But sure, let's keep parroting the people who said that ICU beds would take two more months to fill up and that asymptotic transmission doesn't exist.",2020-04-01 23:55:44
"My GP does not take regular consultations. I really need to see a doctor for a condition that is not flu. How is the situation in other GPs? Is there anything else that I can do to see a doctor ; especially a specialist Doctor? :(",2020-04-01 23:08:52
"Where can I find an overview of the latest restrictions? I got confused by Mark Rutte saying everything will as is till June 2nd, or just the ban for events, then other sources claim end of April.",2020-04-01 18:20:06
"Watch the briefing the RIVM did today, Jaap van Dissel perfectly explains why there is no added value with masks for normal people. Wash your hands and keep your distance is by far the most effective way. A face mask adds nothing if we keep doing the important stuff.",2020-04-01 14:02:29
"Medical personnel need it far more than regular people do and there is a shortage. So if you have any, call your GP and make sure they get them.",2020-04-01 13:53:13
"If you go outside wear a mask if possible, sure, it does not give 100% protection but every little bit helps in my view, the only reason some people are arguing against wearing masks is because of *""they are meant for medical personnel""*, well, if it's protecting medical personnel in some way it also protects you in the same manner, just wear a mask if you go outside, in some countries it is already mandatory...for a reason!",2020-04-01 11:01:33
